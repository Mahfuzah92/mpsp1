E-AGREEMENT MPSP

Hi Everybody!

I am Mahfuzah, currently doing my industrial training (PRACTICAL STUDENT) at MPSP in IT Dept untill 30 June 2017. My course name is Information System Management (IM245) social science NOT a pure IT actually. I had assigned to develop 1 system which is from using manual form to become a system. Languange that I learn and use is PHP,MYSQL and WAMP. Buttt....to develop this system I need helpp because I am not good at all in coding.

**The form name is Agreement Form which is always be used by Law deparment in MPSP as evidence between suppliers and MPSP signed any tender. So, I am here to asking/seeking for help from anyone intelligent, brilliant and kind hearted person to help me in order to develop Electronic Agreement MPSP or also known as E-AGREEMENT MPSP.

In my opinion, a good system should have this:

NEW USER LOGIN
LOGIN
WELCOME/HOME PAGE
AGREEMENT FORM
VIEW FORM
PRINT FORM AS EVIDENCE
LOGOUT
BUTT....im still loading to do all this. Hope that someone can help me to achieve my dream and goal thus I can finish my project during my practical with successful.
